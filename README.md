# Five_card_draw
Part of OOP Course

This was one of the biggest projects we made in two years of CS program. It is a game called Five Card Draw, where a player is palying against an algorithm. The project include code for a dumbCPU player, that makes random choices, and a smartCPU player, that makes choices that will not risk to make the deck worse. 

The project also implements a set of thorough JUnit Tests.

The graphical interface was given to us, along with a list of project requirements that included making a dumbCPU player that made random moves and a smartCPU player that did not have to be complex, but actually had to make some reasonable moves, implementing thorough unit tests, and the rules of the game. The rest of the project was up to the student to make.
